# Program to reverse a number

# Take input from the user
x = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Initialize a variable to store the reversed number
rev = 0

# Loop until the number becomes 0
while x != 0:
    rem = x % 10          # Get the last digit of the number
    rev = rev * 10 + rem  # Add the digit to the reversed number
    x = x // 10           # Remove the last digit from the original number

# Display the reversed number
print("Reversed number:", rev)
