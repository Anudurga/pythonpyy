# Program: Count Frequency of Elements in a List
# Problem:
# Given a list of elements, count how many times each element appears.

# Input:
l = [1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1]

# Create an empty dictionary to store frequency
frequency = {}

# Count occurrences of each element
for item in l:
    if item in frequency:
        frequency[item] += 1
    else:
        frequency[item] = 1

# Print frequency of each element
for key, value in frequency.items():
    print(f"'{key}' is repeated {value} times")

Output:
'1' is repeated 4 times
'2' is repeated 2 times
'3' is repeated 2 times
'4' is repeated 1 times
