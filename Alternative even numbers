# Program to print alternate even numbers between two numbers

# Taking input from the user
a = int(input("Enter a: "))
b = int(input("Enter b: "))

c = 0  # Counter to track alternate numbers

# Loop from a+1 to b-1 (exclusive of a and b)
for i in range(a + 1, b):
    if i % 2 == 0:  # Check if number is even
        if c % 2 == 0:  # Print only alternate even numbers
            print(i, end=" ")
        c += 1  # Increment counter
Input:
Enter a: 10
Enter b: 30
Output:
12 16 20 24 28
