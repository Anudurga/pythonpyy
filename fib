# Fibonacci series using a for loop

# Take input from the user for the number of terms
x = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))

# Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers
a, b = 0, 1

# Loop to generate the Fibonacci series up to x terms
for i in range(1, x + 1):
    print(a, end=" ")  # Print the current Fibonacci number
    c = a + b          # Calculate the next Fibonacci number
    a = b              # Update a to the previous b
    b = c              # Update b to the newly calculated Fibonacci number
Enter the number of terms: 7
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 




# Fibonacci Series up to a given number using while loop

# Ask the user to input a number
x = int(input("Enter the value of x: "))

# Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers
a = 0
b = 1

# Generate and print Fibonacci numbers until 'a' exceeds x
while a <= x:
    print(a, end=" ")  # Print current Fibonacci number
    c = a + b          # Compute the next Fibonacci number
    a = b              # Shift 'a' to next number
    b = c              # Shift 'b' to next number
