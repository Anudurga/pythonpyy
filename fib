# Fibonacci series using a for loop

# Take input from the user for the number of terms
x = int(input("Enter the number of terms: "))

# Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers
a, b = 0, 1

# Loop to generate the Fibonacci series up to x terms
for i in range(1, x + 1):
    print(a, end=" ")  # Print the current Fibonacci number
    c = a + b          # Calculate the next Fibonacci number
    a = b              # Update a to the previous b
    b = c              # Update b to the newly calculated Fibonacci number
Input:
Enter the number of terms: 7
Output:
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 




# Fibonacci Series up to a given number using while loop
# Ask the user to input a number
x = int(input("Enter the value of x: "))

# Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers
a = 0
b = 1

# Generate and print Fibonacci numbers until 'a' exceeds x
while a <= x:
    print(a, end=" ")  # Print current Fibonacci number
    c = a + b          # Compute the next Fibonacci number
    a = b              # Shift 'a' to next number
    b = c              # Shift 'b' to next number
Input:
Enter the value of x: 10
Output:
0 1 1 2 3 5 8




# Fibonacci Characters Program
# This program prints letters of the alphabet according to Fibonacci sequence positions.

# Take input from the user
x = int(input("Enter the limit (x): "))

# Initialize the first two Fibonacci numbers
a = 0
b = 1

# Generate Fibonacci sequence and print corresponding characters
for i in range(1, x):
    print(chr(97 + a), end=" ")  # chr(97) = 'a', 97 + a gives the alphabet
    if a > x:  # Stop if the Fibonacci number exceeds x
        break
    c = a + b  # Next Fibonacci number
    a = b
    b = c
Input:
Enter the limit (x): 10
Output:
a b b c d f i




# Program to print letters corresponding to Fibonacci numbers using a while loop

# Initialize first two Fibonacci numbers
a = 0
b = 1

# Loop until the Fibonacci number reaches 26 (number of letters in the alphabet)
while a < 26:
    # Print the character corresponding to the current Fibonacci number
    # chr(97 + a) converts 0 -> 'a', 1 -> 'b', 2 -> 'c', etc.
    print(chr(97 + a), end=" ")
    
    # Update Fibonacci numbers
    c = a + b
    a = b
    b = c
Output:
a b c f k u
