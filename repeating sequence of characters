#solution 1
# Program to print pattern: 1 a @ 1 a @ ...

# Taking input from user
a = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Loop through 0 to a-1
for i in range(a):
    if i % 3 == 0:
        print("1", end=" ")
    elif i % 3 == 1:
        print("a", end=" ")
    else:
        print("@", end=" ")
Input
Enter a number: 10
Output :
1 a @ 1 a @ 1 a @ 1




#solution 2
# Program: Print a sequence with 1, a, @ repeating pattern
# Author: Your Name
# Description:
# This program takes an integer input 'a' from the user and prints
# a repeating sequence of characters: 1, a, @.
# The sequence continues until 'a' number of elements are printed.

# Example:
# Input: 5
# Output: 1 a @ 1 a

# Taking input from user
a = int(input("Enter how many terms you want to print: "))

# Initial value of the sequence
c = "1"

# Loop through 'a' times
for i in range(a):
    print(c, end=" ")  # Print the current character without new line

    # Update 'c' to the next character in the sequence
    if c == "1":
        c = "a"
    elif c == "a":
        c = "@"
    else:
        c = "1"
