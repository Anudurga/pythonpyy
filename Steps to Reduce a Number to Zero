# Program: Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero
# Description: Given a number x, we reduce it to zero.
# If the number is even, divide it by 2.
# If the number is odd, subtract 1.
# The program counts the number of steps required.

Example Input/Output:
Input: 14
Steps:
14 -> 7 -> 6 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0
Output: Number of steps to reduce 0 to zero: 6

Input: 8
Steps:
8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0
Output: Number of steps to reduce 0 to zero: 4


# Input
x = int(input("Enter a number x: "))

# Initialize step counter
steps = 0

# Process
while x != 0:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        x //= 2      # If even, divide by 2
    else:
        x -= 1       # If odd, subtract 1
    steps += 1       # Count each operation

# Output
print(f"Number of steps to reduce {x} to zero: {steps}")


Enter a number x: 14
Steps:
14 is even → 14 ÷ 2 = 7
7 is odd → 7 − 1 = 6
6 is even → 6 ÷ 2 = 3
3 is odd → 3 − 1 = 2
2 is even → 2 ÷ 2 = 1
1 is odd → 1 − 1 = 0

Output:
Number of steps to reduce 0 to zero: 6
