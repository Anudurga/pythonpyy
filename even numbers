# Solution 1
# Loop through numbers from 1 to 10
for i in range(1, 11):  # Generates numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
    if i == 10:
        # If the number is 10, print it without a trailing comma and end with a dot
        print(i, end=".")
    elif i % 2 == 0:
        # If the number is even (2, 4, 6, 8), print it followed by a comma
        print(i, end=",")

Expected Output
2,4,6,8,10.


# Solution 2
"""
Program: Print even numbers up to (x-1) with a comma separator,
and end the last number with a dot (.)
Handles both even and odd inputs.

Example:
Input: 4
Output: 2.

Input: 7
Output: 2,4,6.
