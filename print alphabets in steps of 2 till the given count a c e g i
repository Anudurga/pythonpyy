# Program to print alphabets in steps of 2 till the given count
# Example: a c e g i ...

# Taking input from user
x = int(input("Enter the number of letters you want to print (up to 26): "))

# Printing the series using ASCII values
for i in range(0, x, 2):
    print(chr(97 + i), end=" ")
Input:
Enter the number of letters you want to print (up to 26): 17
Output:
a c e g i k m o q




# Program to print characters in a specific pattern
# Starting from 'a' (ASCII 97), incrementing by i each time (i starts from 2)

ch = 97  # ASCII value of 'a'
i = 2    # Step size, which increases after each iteration

while ord('z') > ch:  # Continue until ch is less than ASCII of 'z'
    print(chr(ch), end=" ")  # Convert ASCII to character and print
    ch += i  # Increase ch by current step size
    i += 1   # Increase step size for next loop


Output
a c f j o u
