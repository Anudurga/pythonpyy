# Program to print all odd numbers from 1 up to a number a
# The last odd number is printed with a '.', all others with ','

# Take input from the user
a = int(input("Enter a number: "))  # Example: 11

# Initialize l to 0
l = 0

# Determine the last odd number to print with a '.'
if a % 2 != 0:
    # If a is odd, the last odd number before a is a-2
    l = a - 2
else:
    # If a is even, the last odd number before a is a-1
    l = a - 1

# Loop through numbers from 1 to a-1
for i in range(1, a):
    if i == l:
        # Print the last odd number with a period
        print(i, end=".")
    elif i % 2 != 0:
        # Print odd numbers followed by a comma
        print(i, end=",")
