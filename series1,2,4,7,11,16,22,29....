# Program to print the series: 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, ...
# Each term is obtained by adding an incrementally increasing number to the previous term
# Increment starts from 1 and increases by 1 for each next term

# Take user input for the maximum number (x) up to which series should be printed
x = int(input("Enter the maximum number (x): "))

# Initialize the first term
count = 1
print("Series up to", x, "is:")
print(count, end=" ")  # Print the first term

# Generate and print the rest of the series
for i in range(1, x):
    count += i
    if count <= x:
        print(count, end=" ")
    else:
        break  # Stop if the next term exceeds x

Input:
Enter the maximum number (x): 30
Output:
Series up to 30 is:
1 2 4 7 11 16 22 29





# Program to print the series: 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, ...
# Each term increases by a difference that starts at 1 and increases by 1 each time.

# Input from user
x = int(input("Enter the maximum number (x): "))

# Initialize the first number and the difference
current = 1
diff = 1

print("Series up to", x, "is:")

# Loop to generate and print the series
while current <= x:
    print(current, end=" ")
    current += diff  # add the current difference
    diff += 1        # increment the difference for next term


Input:
Enter the maximum number (x): 30
Output:
Series up to 30 is:
1 2 4 7 11 16 22 29
