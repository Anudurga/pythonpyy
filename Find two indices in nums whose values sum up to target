# Problem: Find two indices in nums whose values sum up to target
nums = [3, 4, 5, 6]
target = 7

# Loop through each element as the first number
for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
    # Loop through each element after i as the second number
    for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
            print([i, j])  # Print the indices as a list
            break  # Stop after finding the first valid pair
            break  # Stop after finding the first valid pair
Output:
[0, 1]
