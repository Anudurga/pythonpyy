# Program: Fit-Bit Printer
# This program takes an integer 'x' from the user
# and prints a sequence from 1 to x with the following rules:
# 1. If the number ends with 1 (like 1, 11, 21...), print "1".
# 2. If the number is divisible by 5, print "fitbit".
# 3. If the number is even (divisible by 2), print "fit".
# 4. Otherwise, print "bit".

# Input
x = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# Processing & Output
for i in range(1, x + 1):
    if i % 10 == 1:         # numbers ending with 1
        print(1)
    elif i % 5 == 0:        # multiples of 5
        print("fitbit")
    elif i % 2 == 0:        # even numbers
        print("fit")
    else:                   # odd numbers not ending with 1
        print("bit")
