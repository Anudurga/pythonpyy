# Function to calculate the factorial of a number using recursion
def factorial(n):
    # Base case: if n is 0, return 1
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        # Recursive case: multiply n by factorial of (n - 1)
        return n * factorial(n - 1)

# Calling the factorial function with 5 as input
print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
