# Program to find all numbers divisible by 6, 9, and both 6 & 9 in the range 10 to 100

count_6 = 0      # Counter for numbers divisible by 6
count_9 = 0      # Counter for numbers divisible by 9
count_both = 0   # Counter for numbers divisible by both 6 and 9

print("Numbers divisible by both 6 and 9:")

for i in range(10, 101):
    if i % 6 == 0 and i % 9 == 0:  # divisible by both 6 and 9
        print(i, end="\n")
        count_both += 1
    if i % 6 == 0:                 # divisible by 6
        count_6 += 1
    if i % 9 == 0:                 # divisible by 9
        count_9 += 1


print("Total numbers divisible by both 6 and 9:", count_both)
print("Total numbers divisible by 6:", count_6)
print("Total numbers divisible by 9:", count_9)


output:

36 
54 
72 
90 


Total numbers divisible by both 6 and 9: 5
Total numbers divisible by 6: 16
